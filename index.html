            <p id="bwtext">
                So darn eh? That game jam came and went. And on account of my new studies I was not able to keep up.<br> 
                But not to worry, I got pretty far and I quite enjoy what I have so far.
            
            </p>

                Will it come out? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe? I’m certainly planning on it,<br> 
                but plans tend to not mean much when you have ADD.
            </p>
            <p id="bwtext">
                Meanwhile, I’m going to focus on school, since that’s something I gotta do now.<br> 
                I will also work on finishing the website. I’m going to be adding things to the portfolio,<br> 
                so keep a look out for that.

            <p id="bwtext">
                Happy new year! <br> 
                From January 17th to January 31st, I'll be participating in the 16th Pirate Software Game Jam! <br>
                Schmebsters Dictionary defines <b>"Game Jam"</b> as <b>"a food made by boiling video games and sugar to a thick consistency"</b>
            
            </p>
            <img id="bwimage" src="images/bloggraphics/b001/blog001-makegame.png" style="width: 296px;">
            <p id="bwtext">
                During this time period, I as well as thousands of other people, will be creating our own small games based on the theme that is revealed when the Jam starts. <br>
                Once finished, the game will be playable here and on my <a href="https://itsphooey.itch.io/" target="_blank" style="color: white;">itch.io page.</a>
            </p>
            <p id="bwtext">
                This is the first game jam I've ever participated in, which is slightly intimidating. <br>
                I'm confident enough in my Unity skills, and I at least <b>somewhat</b> know what I'm doing when it comes to game design. <br>
                We are allowed to team up with other people, but I think I'm going solo for this one. <br> 
                My friends aren't awfully into game development, and I do not feel like getting to know new people, <br>
                so watch me raw-dog this jam solo style.
